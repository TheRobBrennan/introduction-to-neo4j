# Welcome

This folder has been created to track my work and ideas while studying [Getting More Out of Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/part-7/)

For my own learning purposes, I will include sections of text from the original course to solidify my own understanding of the concepts presented.

## About this module

You have learned how to set up your development environment for accessing a Neo4j graph and how to write basic Cypher statements for querying the graph modifying the graph.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

+ Use parameters in your Cypher statements.
+ Analyze Cypher execution.
+ Monitor queries.
+ Manage constraints and node keys for the graph.
+ Import data into a graph from CSV files.
+ Manage indexes for the graph.
+ Access Neo4j resources.

## Cypher parameters

### Using Cypher parameters

### Exercise 12: Using Cypher parameters

## Analyzing Cypher execution

## Monitoring queries

### Exercise 13: Analyzing and monitoring queries

## Managing constraints and node keys

### Ensuring that a property value for a node is unique

### Ensuring that properties exist

### Retrieving constraints defined for the graph

### Dropping constraints

### Creating node keys

### Exercise 14: Managing constraints and node keys

## Managing indexes

### Indexes for range searches

### Creating indexes

### Retrieving indexes

### Dropping indexes

### Exercise 15: Managing indexes

## Going from relational to graph with Neo4j

## Importing data

### Importing normalized data using LOAD CSV

### Importing denormalized data

### Importing a large dataset

### Exercise 16: Importing data

## Accessing Neo4j resources

There are many ways that you can learn more about Neo4j. A good starting point for learning about the resources available to you is the Neo4j Learning Resources page at [https://neo4j.com/developer/resources/](https://neo4j.com/developer/resources/).

## Check your understanding

### Question 1

What Cypher keyword can you use to prefix any Cypher statement to examine how many db hits occurred when the statement executed?

Select the correct answer.

[ ] ANALYZE
[ ] EXPLAIN
[ ] PROFILE
[ ] MONITOR

### Question 2

What types of constraints can you define for a graph that are asserted when a node or relationship is created or updated?

Select the correct answers.

[ ] unique values for a property of a node
[ ] unique values for a property of a relationship
[ ] a node must have a certain set of properties with values
[ ] a relationship must have a certain set of properties with values

### Question 3

In general, what is the maximum number of nodes or relationships that you can easily create using LOAD CSV?

Select the correct answer.

[ ] 1K
[ ] 10K
[ ] 1M
[ ] 10M

## Summary

You should now be able to:

+ Use parameters in your Cypher statements.
+ Analyze Cypher execution.
+ Monitor queries.
+ Manage constraints and node keys for the graph.
+ Import data into a graph from CSV files.
+ Manage indexes for the graph.
+ Access Neo4j resources.
